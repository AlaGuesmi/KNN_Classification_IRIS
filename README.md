# KNN_Classification_IRIS

This project demonstrates how to apply the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the **Iris dataset**, which is built into R. The Iris dataset consists of measurements of three types of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

üîç **Objective**

The goal is to classify iris flowers based on their features (sepal length/width and petal length/width) using the KNN algorithm and evaluate the model‚Äôs performance.

üìå **Steps Followed**

1. Randomize the dataset

  Shuffle the rows of the Iris dataset to ensure randomness and avoid bias.

2. Normalize the data
   
  Apply Min-Max standardization to scale the numeric features between 0 and 1.

3. Split the dataset
   
  Divide the dataset into a training set and a test set to build and evaluate the model.

4. Run the KNN algorithm
   Use KNN to classify each test observation based on the training data.

5. Evaluate model performance
   Assess the global accuracy and performance of the KNN classification results.
